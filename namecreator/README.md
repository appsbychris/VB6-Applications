#A 'smarter' random name creator

My code randomly will create a name, varied in length (Customizable by the user) and display the name into a list box. The user has an option to use a last name for there 'random name'. 
My code scans a text file with common 'combos' of letter that you may see together a lot. 
It will then (on a random chance) make sure those letters are together in the random name. THe user also has an option to choose the first letter of each of the first and last name. 
Also included is a name combiner. 
You can input 2 to 5 names and this program will generate a name from the letters you gave it.
In here, you also have the option of choose a length for the name, the first letter of the name (first and last) and to make a last name.
This program will be great for any RPG er's or anyone who is makeing a game and doesnt like thinking up of a lot of different names.
With my program, you are able to save the names you use for future reference.
Also, i have included a way to copy a selected name to the clipboard, in case the name is long and you don't wish to type it up, or just because you are lazy.
