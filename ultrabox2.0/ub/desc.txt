This is an update to my previous submission.
New updates include:
 *A picture can be added to the begining of each item, with optional transparency.
 *Bold, Italic, Underline can be added to the items, with the ability to have only part of the string any of those three (or a combo of them)
 *Can Enabled/Disable the whole listbox
 *Has a Sorted property to sort the list in ABC order. (A bit slow, but its the best I could make, 100 items takes about 1 second)
 *MultiSelect, ability to select more then 1 item, while holding down the CTRL button.
Other original features:
 *Multicolored items
 *Check/Option items
 *Horizontal Scrollbar
 *Find method and FindInStr.
   >Find matches exact string
   >FindInstr works if the input is found anywhere in the item, it will be triggered as found.
 *Enabled/Disable certain items
 *Progressbar Item
 *Fill View as either Lined or NoStyle
   >Lined with have every other item a light grey, and the other items white.
 *5 Different Border Styles
   >Raised
   >Sunken
   >Etched
   >Bumped
   >Line
   >None

To come: A Print method that will allow you to print out the list in a number of formats.  I am still having some trouble on this part, but it will come.
