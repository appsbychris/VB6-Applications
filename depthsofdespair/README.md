#Depths Of Despair MUD Stand-alone server.

              This game is not complete, but is massive. I think i have given up 
              working on it, seeing as i havn't touched it for awhile now. I would
              guess that is is about 80-90% complete, maybe even more.
              Game features include: movement, items, spells, weapons, monsters, quest,
              combat, time system, money system, rooms can have doors, emotions, evil 
              system, familiars, private user guilds, hunger/stamina system, ability
              to write notes in game and leave for other players, ability to form travel
              party with players, projecttile weapons (guns/bows and arrows), shop's are
              set up, players can sneak and backstab for more damage, theiving system,
              train and level up and adjust stats how you want, Custom scripting launguage
              to add many more custom commands, monsters roam the realm,  plus many more 
              im sure i've forgotton.
              
              This game is about 30,900 lines of code. Lots to look through. I've included
              all the documents i've compiled as i've created this. It could help decode
              how things work.
              
              The database for the game is bassed in Access, so im not sure if it will work
              if you don't have it. It can accept telnet connections from most any client.
              It sends out the text with ANSI codes for color, so a client with color would
              be the best. XP telnet works great.
              
              I have also included a telnet client i was working on. It isn't complete or 
              perfect, but it works pretty decent. But it is just a barebones applicaiton.
              
              The games purpose was to be a completely editable MUD, so things can be changed
              drastically. I have included an editor (and this also isn't copmlete...), but its
              about 90% complete with some bugs in it. It can also explain how lots of things work.
              
              There is tons more inside this project, but i would have to write so much, it would
              be better to just check it out.
              
              Feel free to use this code or whatever, just don't make any profit from it, unless
              you include me. And keep my name attached to what you take. I don't claim to have
              wrote every line, but i was say a good 95% is mine.
              
              
              To run it, run the server. Then get a client and connect to your own IP. If you
              don't know it, the server will tell you. Its listed on the main screen.
              Once your connected through the client, you can either create a new account, or 
              log into one of my test accounts.
              Userid: master
              password: test
              
              Userid: spike
              password: test
              
              userid: thrice
              password:test
              
              I know master is pretty much invincible, and can be used to test things.
              
              Some commands are:
              n,s,e,w,ne,se,nw,sw,u,d   - movement
              i - inventory list
              g [item] - pick up item in room
              a [monster] - attack monster in room
              eq [item] - equip an item in your inventory
              
              those are some basic commands that will help you start out.
              check the documents, there are more commands listed, and check out the modules
              to see what commands do what.
