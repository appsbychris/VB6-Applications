An item looks like: :0/0/E{}F{}A{}/0;

:ItemID/Dur/E{Enchants}F{Flags}A{Adjectives}/Uses;


Now..too add bullets, etc...would have to do something like this:

:0/0/E{}F{}A{}B{0|0|0|0}/0;

B{} is set up like this:
B{Amount OF Bullets|ItemID|Magical(0 or 1)|MANA cost}

The USES slot is used for MAX BULLETS in the bow/gun item.
