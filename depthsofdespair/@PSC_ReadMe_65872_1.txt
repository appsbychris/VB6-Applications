This game is not complete, but is massive. I think i have given up 
working on it, seeing as i havn't touched it for awhile now. I would
guess that is is about 80-90% complete, maybe even more.
Game features include: movement, items, spells, weapons, monsters, quest,
combat, time system, money system, rooms can have doors, emotions, evil 
system, familiars, private user guilds, hunger/stamina system, ability
to write notes in game and leave for other players, ability to form travel
party with players, projecttile weapons (guns/bows and arrows), shop's are
set up, players can sneak and backstab for more damage, theiving system,
train and level up and adjust stats how you want, Custom scripting launguage
to add many more custom commands, monsters roam the realm, plus many more 
im sure i've forgotton.
This game is about 30,900 lines of code. Lots to look through. I've included
all the documents i've compiled as i've created this. It could help decode
how things work.
The database for the game is bassed in Access, so im not sure if it will work
if you don't have it. It can accept telnet connections from most any client.
It sends out the text with ANSI codes for color, so a client with color would
be the best. XP telnet works great.
I have also included a telnet client i was working on. It isn't complete or 
perfect, but it works pretty decent. But it is just a barebones applicaiton.
The games purpose was to be a completely editable MUD, so things can be changed
drastically. I have included an editor (and this also isn't copmlete...), but its
about 90% complete with some bugs in it. It can also explain how lots of things work.
There is tons more inside this project, but i would have to write so much, it would
be better to just check it out.
Feel free to use this code or whatever, just don't make any profit from it, unless
you include me. And keep my name attached to what you take. I don't claim to have
wrote every line, but i was say a good 95% is mine.
