<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Once you have a Tic, choose the
'Setup for Tic' button before you discard a card.&nbsp; A new screen will come
up, and your hand will be shown.&nbsp; You now must set your cards aside, one
group at a time.&nbsp; Drag a card onto the label named 'Set for group' area, and it should
appear in a list.&nbsp; Once you have your first group, click the button below
called 'Set Aside' the list to set it aside.&nbsp; If it is a valid set, they will disappear.&nbsp;
Now drag your next group (if any) onto the 'Set for group' area, and continue as needed.&nbsp;
Once all your groups are set aside, you should have 1 card left, which that card
you drag to the 'Discard this card' label area.&nbsp; Once that card is in there, you can choose
the 'Done' button, and you have just tic'ed out.&nbsp; If you made a mistake,
you can choose the 'Redo' button to redo the whole hand.&nbsp; Or if you don't
want to Tic out right now, or can't, choose the 'Cancel' button.</font></p>
