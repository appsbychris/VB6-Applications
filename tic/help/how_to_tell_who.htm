<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">How to tell who's turn it is-</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Comic Sans MS"> It is easy to see who's turn it
currently is.&nbsp; Under the deck, there is a space with the label of 'Active.&nbsp; Whoever is to the right of that label is the current active
player.&nbsp; Also, whenever someone ends their turn, in the chat screen, a
message will say 'so and so has ended their turn, and now so and so's turn has
begun'.&nbsp; Be sure to watch for that message too.</font></p>
