<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp; You can choose how many decks you wish to
use in the game.&nbsp; The default amount of decks to use is 2.&nbsp; You can
choose to use up to 5 decks in a game.&nbsp; Two decks is enough cards for up to
4 people.&nbsp; Sometimes it is enough for 5 or 6 people.&nbsp; But to be on the
safe side, if you are hosting a game with 4, 5, or 6 people, you may want to up
the amount of decks to 3.&nbsp; If you just want to have lots of cards, you can
add more and more decks to the game.</font></p>
