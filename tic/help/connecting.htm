<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Connecting to a game-</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Comic Sans MS"> To connect to a game, you must have
a server to connect to, and that server's IP address.&nbsp; If you want to just
play a 1 player game, check here.&nbsp; Once you know the IP of the server you
are wanting to connect to, go to the menu, and choose 'Connect' sub menu.&nbsp;
Then choose 'Connect to remote server' (Shortcut of ALT+C).&nbsp; Fill in the information that is required (The IP
address, and your nickname).&nbsp; Choose the connect button, and the program
will attempt to connect.&nbsp; On the server, you will know if you are connected
if your name appears in the 'Users online' section.&nbsp; Another way to see if
you are connected is on the bar at the top of the window will say &quot;Tic Game
Board [ver x.xx], Connected as yourname (ipyourconnectedto)&quot;.</font></p>
