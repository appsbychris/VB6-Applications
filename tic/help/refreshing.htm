players has to leave, or loses there connection, and does not reconnect.&nbsp;
This will remove anyone who is not currently connected from the game, and
reorder players so that they will not lose the points they have got to this
point.&nbsp; Refreshing can be risky.&nbsp; What it does is disconnect all users
from the server, and saves all the data.&nbsp; Then the users should auto-reconnect
in about 5 - 10 seconds, and the game will restart with the first player to
reconnect.&nbsp; If a user doesn't reconnect within a certain amount of time,
they will not be added back to the game.&nbsp; The game cannot continue until
all players that were connect originally reconnect back to the server, so use
this option with caution.</font></p>
